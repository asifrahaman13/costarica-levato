    "1. Retry mechanism: Ensuring more robustness to the system. We can have a retry mechanism upo n times in case there is any error in generating the tables from SQL query. The function can be algorithmically programmed in such a way that current iteration acutally have the error caused from the previous iteration.\n",
    "2. A validator agent can be created which would be specially trained to validate the generated SQL query (returns either valid as True or False).\n",
    "3. Feedback mechanism: We can retrain the system each time the LLM gives correct result. This can act as a reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy of the system. \n",
    "4. Usage of SQL Linter: A good way of validating the generated the SQL data is through the usage of SQL linter eg: https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff.git. This can help to reduce any linting issue or any form of error in the SQL query. It can handle the syntax error.\n",
    "5. Storing the wrong results in a separate db to later work on the test cases would be great help. (Needs a good amount of manual tasks.)"
